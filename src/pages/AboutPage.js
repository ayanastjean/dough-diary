            The Dough Diary was created in 2024 in sunny Orlando, born out of a lifelong passion for baking and the joy of sharing knowledge. 
            Itâ€™s a space designed to provide tips, tricks, and lessons learned along the baking journey. 
            Whether kneading dough for the first time or perfecting a sourdough loaf, bakers of all levels can come together, share experiences, and grow their love for baking.
